# xmrd
deamonize xmr mining

Purpose of this is to use a linux ubuntu binary for xmr mining on my linux computers and having it start as a service at boot.

If others want to use this to get theyr cpu up and running xmr mining remember to change the wallet adress in config.txt
The config is default for 4 cores.
